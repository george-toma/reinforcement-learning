# reinforcement-learning
The scope of this project is to try reinforcement learning algorithm (QLearning) on a 1D geometrical shape. In a matrix the agent tries to design a 1D shape with a certain orientation. The matrix size can be configured  under Game.java object.

At this moment the target 1D shape is as follow:
```
 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0
 1 1 1 1
```
 The agent will try for several episodes to create the needed shape and orientation.
