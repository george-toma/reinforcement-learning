# reinforcement-learning
The scope of this project is to try reinforcement learning algorithm on a 1D geometrical shape. In a matrix the agent tries to design the 1D shape on a matrix in the orientation desired by the user.
Note that the user should validate if the shape or desired orientation is correct of not in the matrix.
